Basic is a project I am working on to test how to write plugins but also to learn how to use GitHub.
This is my first GitHub project.

The Basic Plugin tests various basic features I am learning to develop and various functions needed to run a plugin.

*  Reading and writing from a config.yml file
*  Permissions based commands using the Permissions plugin
*  Scheduled Tasks
*  Using a hashSet to determine if a player has used a command.
*  Setting up a scheduled task to disable a player from using a command for a set period of time.
*  Set up Listener classes for player and block events
